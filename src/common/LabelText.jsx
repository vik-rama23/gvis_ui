freedom, and equality for all. Thus, education is extremely 
necessary for all. No good life is possible without education. It 
endorses the intelligence of human beings, develops his skill, and 
enables him to be industrious.”
 Our mission at Green Valley International School is definitive. Here 
each child receives an education which is skill based and develops his 
critical and logical thinking. Every child is trained to build an irrevocable 
conviction about right and wrong and evolves as a unique individual 
capable of taking stock of each situation, forming correct decisions 
without losing sight of the societal values. 
We firmly believe that parents role in the Child's educational 
development is crucial. It is the parents who are the first GURU of the 
child. So we create sturdy rapport and strive to establish continuous 
communication between parents, teachers and administration.
 The management and staff of Green Valley International School is 
deeply committed to work tirelessly in order to make our students' 
learning experience an exciting and elucidating one`;


export const principalMessage = ` We live in a world that demands excellence, creativity and 
competitions. Everyone hopes to outwit the other and as a great 
philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre says, “The other is a hell or menace for 
everyone.” One feels that the other may snatch his or her prospect. It is 
here that we need to scrutinize the need of education. Education 
ought not to teach one to compete with the other but rather compete 
with oneself to eliminate what is irreconcilable and to furnish oneself 
with the armor of knowledge and wisdom to stand for oneself and the 
other. GVIS believes in the holistic development of the children. 
Implementation of a well-balanced curriculum ensures us to cater the 
intelligence quotient, emotional quotient and spiritual quotient of the 
children with apposite environment. Our well qualified and well
disciplined faculty deems that success comes to those who work hard 
and stays with those who don't rest on the laurels of the past. 
Spirituality, morality and teamwork are the hallmark of GVIS. What we 
are is God's gift to us, what we become is our gift to God. Therefore, let 
us strive to perfection and it is quite sure that a collaborative effort can 
bring the best that is yet to come.`;
